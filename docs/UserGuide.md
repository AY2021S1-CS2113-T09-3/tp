### 2. Quote Management
### 3. Progress Tracker
### 4. Category Management
### 5. Rating System for books
The rating system in Quotesify allows you to rate your books from 1 to 5 star. With this system, you will not forget
how you feel about the books you read, and will always be ready to recommend a book to a fellow book reader.
Ratings can be edited whenever you change your mind about the book, or be deleted when you are not interested
in that rating anymore. Ratings can also be listed according to their ratings - with your favourites at the top - as
