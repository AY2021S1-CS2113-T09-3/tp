# Developer Guide

## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Feature: Add rating
The proposed *add rating* feature will rely on an existing book object, and a rating object will then be created
in the process.
* The book object will store an attribute named rating, which will be set by this feature.
* The rating object will be made up of the book object and a rating score, which is stored in a list of ratings
named Rating List.

Given below is the class diagram of classes related to ratings:

[TO INSERT CLASS DIAGRAM HERE]

* A `Book` has a `0..1` multiplicity to `Rating` as a book can have only 1 rating or have not been rated at all.
* A `Rating` has a `1` multiplicity to `Book` as 1 rating represent only 1 book.
* A `Rating` has a `1` multiplicity to `RatingList` as the rating will only be stored in 1 rating list.
* A `RatingList` has a `*` multiplicity to `Rating` as the rating list can stored multiple rating objects.
* There is composition between `Book` and `Rating` as a rating can only be created when the book exists.
The rating will be deleted when the book is deleted.

#### Design consideration:
* The rating object stores a book object, which consists of the book title and author,
instead of only the book title. This will uniquely identify books and allow books with the same title
but different authors to be rated.

### Feature: List rating
The proposed *list rating* feature will print all the rating objects found in the rating list.
* Details stored in the rating objects like the book title, author and its rating score will be printed.
* If a rating score is specified by the user, only rating objects with that rating score will be printed.
* The messages are printed using `Ui` which relies on `UiMessage`.

#### Design consideration:
* The rating list is sorted according to the rating score, with the highest rating at the top. This is for
better user experience where users would usually like to see their favourites and do not need to scroll
all the way to the bottom.

### Feature: Find rating
The proposed *find rating* feature will loop through the rating list to find if the rating exists.
* If the rating is found, the details of the book and its rating score will be printed.
* If the rating is not found, a message to indicate unsucessful search will be printed.
* The messages are printed using `Ui` which relies on `UiMessage`.

### Feature Add bookmark
The proposed add bookmark feature will rely on an existing `Book` object, and then a `Bookmark` object will 
be created in the process.
* The `Bookmark` object will be made up of the `Book` object and a page number, which is stored in a list of 
bookmarks named `BookmarkList`.


## Product scope
